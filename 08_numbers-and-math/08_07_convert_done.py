# Demonstrate how to:
# -------------------
# 1) Convert an int to a float
# 2) Convert a float to an int
# 3) Perform division using a float and an int.
# 4) Use two variables to perform a multiplication.
#
# What information is lost during which conversions?

x=float(10)
y=int(10.234234)
print(x)
print(y)
print(x/y)
print(x*y)

#when it goes from float to int then the decimals get lost
